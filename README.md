An application that allows users to input the hours they slept, and what day it was. Users can also record
what dreams were had on each day.

# Tech Used: HTML, CSS, EJS, Express 
This project took HTML, CSS, EJS, and express to get the desired result. 
# Lessons Learned
This was my third time using Authentication in an app. I learned a new trick that will
forever stay within my toolbox. Using the debugger in chrome inspect tools was a big one for 
me in this project. Allowed me to see what was happening with routes in real time. This also
cemented more of the CRUD functions in my mind, and I now have an easier time using them.
